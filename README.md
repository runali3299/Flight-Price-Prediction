# Flight-Price-Prediction
### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline etc !
### This was a fun project as the dataset which I had was categorical and to convert that into meaningful and mapping numerical values took me some time !
### The accuracy on test data is 80 % and for the train data it goes to 90%
### I have also included the dataset (air_train.xlsx ) , the jupyter notebook(main code) file and the pickle file !
